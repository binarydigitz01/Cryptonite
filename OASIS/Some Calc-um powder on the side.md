In this problem we are given a codepad which uses a html templating syntax, mostly used to render html pages at the backend before serving to the front.
They tell you how to print variables that are passed in the backend, so all you had to do was access potential flag variables.

{{ flag }} would print the flag : OASIS{I_l0v3_w3b_!nj3ct!0n5}
